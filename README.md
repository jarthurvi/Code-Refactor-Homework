# Code-Refactor-Homework 
This is the submission for the "Code-Refactor" homework assignment. 
The html was modified by changing the elements to be more relevant to the different sections of the website. 
The CSS document was modified by grouping together things that shared the same styling. 
Nothing about the original "layout" or "look" of the website has been changed.
